# NewsOrgOnMastodon
The NewsOrgOnMastodon system of Mastodon accounts aims to deliver news and media organizations' presence to Mastodon (mastodon.social) by syncing their content to Mastodon from their official platforms such as RSS Feeds, thus serving as an unofficial Mastodon relay-bot of that news/media organization. This system has no legal nor genuine organizational links and are linked unofficially to this system of Mastodon accounts. <br><br>
The operations of NewsOrgOnMastodon system of Mastodon accounts is headed by:<br>

<br><br>
•RSS Feed Proxied (Used for bypassing user-agent issues)<br>
-ABS-CBN News<br>
-Philippine Information Agency<br>
-Philippine Daily Inquirer<br>


## Shutted Down Accounts
•<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@rssphilippinenewsagency">Philippine News Agency (PNA)</a> since June 6, 2025 (Death and Permanent Shutdown)
<br>
The shutdown of this account was due to the stricter Cloudflare blocking that the Philippine News Agency have implemented on their site. My automated scripts are now blocked. It cannot longer be bypassed (as of my current skills).
<br>
But there should be supposed a solution - web scraping services but they are not free and I do not have the money to operate it.
<br>
But I will still do my best to fetch the latest news again from PNA in other ways that are free but I am still failing. Sorry. It's dead for now.
<br>
But if you want to help, just drop an email on admin@gosocial.x10.bz. <br>

## Future Roadmap
== NONE FOR NOW ==


## Deferred Roadmap
Here are the planned organizations to be added on NewsOrgOnMastodon but have been deferred (for now) due to issues that are nearly impossible to solve (atleast based on my current skills).<br>
•News5 (Current Issue: Article Items in Javascript; Hard to Decode)
<br>
•NewsWatchPlus (Current Issue: Inconsistent elements used in their news page)
<br><br>
PS: If you want to help, just give me the URL of the site's RSS Feed or a custom builder PHP script source code for each on admin@gosocial.x10.bz.
