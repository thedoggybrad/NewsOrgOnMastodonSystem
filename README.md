## Deferred Roadmap
Here are the planned organizations to be added on NewsOrgOnMastodon but have been deferred (for now) due to issues that are nearly impossible to solve (atleast based on my current skills).<br>
•News5 (Current Issue: Article Items in Javascript; Hard to Decode)
<br>
•NewsWatchPlus (Current Issue: Inconsistent elements used in their news page)
